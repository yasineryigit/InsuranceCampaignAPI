# Insurance Campaign API

## About the project
This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) that allows users to create and manage campaigns that they can publish and unpublish as they wish, with various campaign-related features. Following feedback from the POC demo, we plan to further develop the project. The POC is designed to be a foundation upon which we can build additional features.

As part of the POC, users can input campaign information, including the campaign title, description, and category. The campaign lifecycle and rules are as follows:

For 'TSS', 'Ã–SS', and 'Other' categories, campaigns are set to "Pending Approval" status upon initial submission. For other categories, campaigns are set to "Active." In other words, campaigns in these categories must be approved before they can be published.
When a campaign is submitted with the same category, title, and description as an existing campaign, it is flagged as a repetitive and cannot be updated.
A campaign that is "Pending Approval" will be set to "Active" once approved. 
Users can deactivate "Active" or "Pending Approval" campaigns.
For this project,  JWT authentication and authorization implemented. As a result, only authenticated and authorized users will be able to submit, update, and deactivate campaigns.
